It occurred about 15 months ago and it turned my life upside down.\n\nI was driving calmly on the highway towards my work, when suddenly a car came from the other side and drove straight at me. I didn't have time to react and before I knew it, the car collided with mine. It was an enormous impact and I lost control of the steering wheel. My car ended up in the guardrail and came to a stop.\n\nThe other driver drove off and left me there. I was in shock and had unbearable pain in my legs. The ambulance came and took me to the hospital, where they discovered that I had broken both legs in multiple places. I had to undergo major surgery and stayed in the hospital for months.\n\nNow, 15 months later, I'm still at home and can barely walk. I'm undergoing intense physical therapy and it's unclear if I'll ever fully recover. Because of the accident, I lost my job and am in a difficult financial situation.\n\nThe worst part is that the government refuses to give me compensation. They claim the accident was my fault, even though I know that's not true. I have witnesses who can confirm that the other car was on my side of the road, but no one seems to want to listen.\n\nI know there is a legal case ongoing, but it has been dragging on for months and I feel like no progress is being made. Meanwhile, the bills keep piling up and I don't know what to do anymore.\n\nI hope you can help me get the justice I deserve. I am desperate and need someone to stand up for my rights. Could you please look into my case and let me know if you can help me?\n\nThank you in advance for your time and effort.\n\nBest regards,"
