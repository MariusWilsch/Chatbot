Hey Marius,

Here is some criteria one of my clients walked me through today.
 I've set the relevant criteria for the company I'm talking with in Dutch, 
 since we would like the output in Dutch for this case. He is also more a fan of the chatbot side, 
 instead of email. So based on the more easiness of chatbot, I'd say maybe get the prototype in chatbot form?

Chatbot to email might be an easier transition than the other way around. 
And maybe easier to show off in a call as prototype. (Will work that out with the guy who preferred email).

Criteria: 
- Jurisdiction (Letselschade)
- Type of accident 
(Not: Medische aansprakelijkheid)('Yes': verkeersongevallen, bedrijfsongevallen, 
ongevallen door dieren, ongevallen door gebrekkig wegdek)

Those are the main hard yes/no's. Then there is dates, which is a little bit more detailed:
- Within a year ago, definite yes. (Small or big cases)
- Over a year ago, we can implement for this demo to have a follow up question like: How long is this case actively running? 
If that is over a year > no
If that is under a year > yes

I think that will do the trick regarding a demo. 
There is much more information needed for the accuracy to go up, but that's for after the demo I'd say.

Let me know if it's clear and good to work with.

    Jurisdiction;
    Claim:
    What happend:
    How did it happen;
    When did it happen;
    Time running case;
}

    Claim:

    How did it happen;
    When did it happen;
    Time running case;
    Letselschade;
    Type of accident;
    How long ago;
}

tekortkomingen:

- met data erg slecht
- data van lopende case niet goed opgepikt
