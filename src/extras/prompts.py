</task>
<attributes>
1. Direct cause: The user must briefly explain the specific event or action that directly led to the situation, dispute, or accident to be counted as given.
2. Parties involved: The user must identify the individuals, groups, or entities involved in the situation to be counted as given.
3. Consequences: The user must describe the specific outcomes or repercussions resulting from the situation to be counted as given.
</attributes>
<extraction_instructions>
1. You must consider any synonyms or similar phrases for these attributes.
2. If any of the mandatory attributes (parties involved, direct cause and the consequences) are not initially provided, you must ask for them only ONCE. 
3. If the user expresses uncertainty or inability to provide a mandatory attribute through phrases (like I'm unsure of the direct cause, ...)  after being asked once you must count the attribute as given.
4. If the user provides some relevant information along with unrelated information, you must ignore only the unrelated parts.
5. If the user provides no relevant information at all and only writes unrelated things, you must count everything as missing. 
6. Never break character and always maintain the role of an AI assistant.

The "missing_key_attributes" field must be an array of strings containing the missing key attributes needed to increase confidence in extracting the necessary information. If no attributes are missing, you must provide an empty array [].
The "confidence" field must be a boolean value indicating whether you have enough information to confidently extract the key attributes. You must use true if confident, false if not confident.
You must ensure that the JSON object is valid and properly formatted.

To generate the confirmation question, follow these steps:

1. Carefully review the provided JSON result, paying close attention to the "Short summary", "situation_begin", "case_started", and "consequences" fields.

  2.3 If legal action has been initiated
  2.4 The main consequences for the user
3. Craft a concise, clear question that restates the key points and asks the user to confirm their accuracy. For example: <result_json> { "Short summary": "The user is involved in a legal dispute with their business partner concerning their jointly owned company, which has resulted in a significant financial loss for the user.", "situation_begin": [ "12 months ago", "2023-04-09" ], "case_started": null, "consequences": [ "significant financial loss" ] } </result_json> Based on this JSON, generate a question like: "Just to confirm, you are in a legal dispute with your business partner over your jointly owned company. The dispute started about 12 months ago, and while you haven't taken legal action yet, it has resulted in significant financial losses for you. Is this correct?"
4. Use a friendly, understanding tone in your question to build trust and rapport with the user.
5. If any critical details are missing or unclear in the provided information, ask for clarification on those specific points.
6. Remember, your primary objective is to verify the accuracy of the information before moving forward, so focus on the most essential aspects of the user's situation in your confirmation question.

Licht letsel
Matig letsel
Ernstig letsel
Zwaar letsel
Zeer zwaar letsel
Uitzonderlijk zwaar letsel

If there is not enough information provided to make a determination for a criteria, output null for that criteria.

The AI will receive an object containing key-value pairs with the following information:
"type_injury": A brief description of the type of injury sustained.
"short_summary": A concise summary of the incident.
"annotations": Key points and relevant information extracted from the chat_history.
"parties_involved": A list of the parties involved in the incident.
